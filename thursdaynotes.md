-function (){}
     -parameters go inside the parentheses, but there don't have to be any     parameters
     - the desired function is inside the {}
     - then we have to call the function
          ex: function setWeather ( condition, city) {
              console.log ('it was' + condition + 'in' + city);
          }
         setWeather( 'stormy', "Phoenix')
         setWeather( 'raining frogs', 'Kalamazoo') 
         OUTPUT = it was raining frogs in Kalamazoo

-camelCase, snake_case 
-console.log () - built in function in the browser, takes as many parameters as you want to pass it, then prints it in the browser
-when you give a VARIABLE a value of a function, you need a semicolon after the function.  Otherwise you do not.

-If/else statements: if () {} else (){}
     if statements look like functions, but they aren't.  We don't need to call it,like we do a function.
-If an if statement evaluates to (false), the code won't run.  It just gets ignored. A false statement will never be true, so it won't run. 

-If/else if statements:
     - if (){} else if(){} else if(){}
     - true/false conditions go inside the parentheses 
     so...if ( condition) {//block of code}
