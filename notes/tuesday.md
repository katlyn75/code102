# Tuesday notes
* #TIL
math operators and types (+, -, *, /, %, )
- the + operator is a string ( it is the only one), no other operators can be used   on anything that is not a number
- NaN means not a number
- concatenation  is when two strings get added together
- comparison ( <,>, ==,===, <=,>=)
- =  means assignment

functions encapsulate code
- draw ()
- changing variables using the operators
- changing values relative to other values
